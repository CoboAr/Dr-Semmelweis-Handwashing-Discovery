## Requirements  

<ul>
  <li>
Open Google Colab Notebook in through your Google Drive. You can find the Python Notebook under New → More → Google Colaboratory     

If you cannot access the Google Colab Notebooks or would like to run everything locally on your computer, then I recommend installing Anaconda and using the bundled Jupyter Notebook instead. Either way works. Google Colab is essentially just an online version of Jupyter.    
</li>

<li>
  Upgrade plotly
</li>
